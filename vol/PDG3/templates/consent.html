                    You have been invited to take part in a research study named The Marbles Game!

                    <ul>
                        <li>18 years of age or older.

                        <li>Fluent speaker of English.
                        </li>

                    This study is designed to investigate how make decisions based on binary probability distributions. You will be asked to choose one of two groups of red and white marbles in order to collect a target color marble.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Your participation in this research is voluntary. You may refrain from answering any questions that make you uncomfortable and may withdraw your participation at any time without penalty by returning the HIT on MTurk and emailing the experimenter at the address provided below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Other than monetary compensation, participating will provide no direct benefits to you. But, we hope that this research will benefit society at large. Many problems that people can solve very easily are very difficult to automate (to have computers solve). By revealing more about how humans learn and think, our research may help others to build and program computers that can solve these kinds of problems.

                    We will not be asking for any personally identifying information, and we will handle responses as confidentially as possible. However, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet. We will be keeping data collected as part of this experiment indefinitely.
